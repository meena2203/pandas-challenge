Two Conclusions from the PyCitySchools data:

1. Academically, Charter schools are the top performers and district schools are the bottom performers - even though charter schools have less per student budget, their students are doing much better (overall pct 90%) than district school students (overall pct 54%). As per the data, one reason for the success of charter schools can be the smaller school size or a smaller number of students (small/ medium ) as compared the district schools (large). With a smaller school size, charter schools can tailor their curriculum and academic focus as per their student population and that might be contributing to their success. An important missing data is the student-teacher ratio for each school type.

2. The major area of concern for district schools is math - although there is a big gap between the overall pass rate of district (54%) and charter schools (90%), the reading pass rate is quite comparable (district - 81%, charter - 84%). It is the math pass rate that is significantly lower for the district schools (77%) as compared to charter schools (83%). More focus needs to be put into improvising math education.
